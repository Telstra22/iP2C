Some or all of the prices in this proposal may be subject to Telstra\u2019s Our Customer Terms and may change from time to time.\nAcceptance of this proposal, or any part of it, is subject to contract (with Telstra or a Telstra group entity) and product or service availability.\n\nConfidentiality Statement\nThe contents of this proposal and any documents provided to you as part of this proposal are confidential information of Telstra and may only be used by you for the purpose of evaluating this proposal. They must not be disclosed to any third party without [COMPANY_NAME]\u2019s prior consent, unless required to do so by law.\nYou acknowledge that Telstra may be required to disclose information that you provide to third parties (such as our suppliers) in order to supply the products and services as set out in this proposal.\nTelstra makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided to you as part of this proposal. You must make your own assessment of the information and satisfy yourself as to its accuracy and completeness.\n\nIntellectual Property\nTelstra and its suppliers retain ownership of all intellectual property subsisting in the contents of this proposal and any documents provided to you as part of this proposal.\n\nTechnical Appraisal\nThe prices and services in this proposal are based on Telstra\u2019s current understanding of your requirements. Technical appraisals or feasibility assessments by Telstra may be required to determine whether Telstra is able to provide the services. If additional design and construction work is required to provide the service(s) (i.e., installation of network infrastructure), further costs may apply and will be advised to you before the commencement of work.\n\nTax Statement\nUnless otherwise expressly stated, all prices in this proposal are exclusive of GST and other transactional taxes (including value-added taxes, charges, withholding taxes, duties (including customs duty and stamp duty), excise, sales tax and other similar taxes) which may be imposed by any taxing authority where the services are being delivered. Telstra reserves the right to recover any GST or other transactional taxes.\n\nTransforming Telstra\nTelstra aims to give customers a personalised, seamless experience that makes it easy for them to do what they want when they want. To achieve this vision, we may introduce new generation services and rationalise or exit legacy services (which may include services set out in this proposal), including, as a result of the NBN rollout. We will discuss these developments with you as the review of our services continues and more details are announced.\n\nNBN Roll Out\nThe National Broadband Network (NBN) is a Federal Government initiative to build a national network that allows all Australians to have access to high-speed broadband in the premises. Telstra has obligations under the Definitive Agreements with NBN Co to progressively disconnect its copper-based access services and HFC broadband services that are provided to premises in the NBN fixed line footprint.\nThe NBN roll-out and our progressive disconnection of copper-based and HFC-based services, in no way, changes our commitment to you as a customer. Most Telstra enterprise and government customers are served by our IP-based products that operate over Telstra's world-class Next IP\u00ae and mobile networks. Telstra will continue to deliver services over these networks.\n            ",

            "content": "### IoT\n\nIn the realm of IoT, Telstra is at the forefront of innovation, leveraging its extensive LTE network to support Cat-M1 and NB-IoT technologies, which cover approximately 3 million and 4 million square kilometers, respectively. This expansive coverage ensures robust connectivity for a range of devices, including sensors, wearables, and industrial wireless sensors, as well as Telstra Locator tags. These devices facilitate asset tracking, industrial monitoring, and location services, offering businesses low-cost, subscription-based tracking solutions with long battery life and low data bandwidth. The integration of RedCap 5G NR further enhances this ecosystem by providing mid-tier throughput, bridging the gap between NB-IoT and full 5G capabilities. Telstra's Wireless M2M Control Centre, powered by Cisco-Jasper, offers advanced provisioning, diagnostics, and usage controls, supported by a sophisticated dashboard with reporting tools and alerts. This infrastructure not only empowers employees with modern tools but also fosters long-term sustainability, driving cost efficiency and operational visibility. With support for roaming overseas and comprehensive helpdesk services, Telstra's IoT solutions are tailored to meet the needs of enterprise, government, and remote businesses, ensuring compliance with standards such as ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and ASAE 3150 (SOC2).\n\n### eSIM\n\nTelstra's eSIM technology represents a significant leap forward in digital transformation, enabling quick activation without the need for a physical SIM card. This innovation is compatible with most phones produced post-2020, as well as tablets, laptops, and connected watches, provided the devices support eSIM functionality. By eliminating the need for physical SIM cards, Telstra reduces warehousing and distribution requirements, supporting sustainability by minimizing plastic use and packaging waste. All Telstra plans are available on eSIM, offering the convenience of dual-number usage on a single device, allowing users to seamlessly manage work and personal communications. While eSIMs are not available for number porting from other providers, the digital provisioning process simplifies logistics and enhances user experience. This approach aligns with modern demands for flexibility and environmental responsibility, reinforcing Telstra's commitment to sustainable practices and cutting-edge technology.\n\n### Satellite\n\nThrough its partnership with Starlink, Telstra is redefining connectivity for regional and remote areas of Australia, offering satellite home internet and enterprise connectivity solutions. The reseller agreement enables Telstra to provide unlimited data plans with an included home phone line, specifically designed for businesses and households in rural and remote locations. Utilizing Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, this service ensures reliable internet access where traditional infrastructure may be lacking. Additionally, Telstra is pioneering satellite-to-mobile capabilities, currently in the proof-of-concept phase, which promises direct-to-handset text messaging. This innovation is complemented by Smart Fix diagnostics, free delivery, and support centers, ensuring seamless service and customer satisfaction. The monthly satellite plan charges are structured to provide value and flexibility, catering to the unique needs of remote communities. As Telstra prepares for the commercial launch of satellite-to-mobile messaging, it continues to expand its product offerings, enhancing coverage and connectivity options for diverse customer segments.",
